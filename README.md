# Facial Emotion Recognition using CNN

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Facial Emotion Recognition** system using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The model classifies human facial expressions into different emotions such as **happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, etc.**

## 📥 Dataset
We use the **FER2013** dataset from Kaggle, which consists of 35,000+ grayscale images of faces labeled with 7 emotions.

### 🔹 Download the Dataset
Run the following command to download the dataset:
```sh
kaggle datasets download -d msambare/fer2013
```
Then extract it:
```sh
unzip fer2013.zip -d data/
```

## ⚙️ Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/4yamneBH/facial-emotion-recognition.git
   cd facial-emotion-recognition
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🏗️ Model Architecture
- Uses a **CNN-based architecture** inspired by **VGG16**
- Includes **data augmentation** and **dropout layers** to prevent overfitting
- Optimized with **Adam optimizer** and **categorical cross-entropy loss**

## 🚀 Training the Model
To train the CNN model, run:
```sh
python src/train.py
```

## 📊 Evaluating the Model
To evaluate the trained model:
```sh
python src/evaluate.py
```

## 🎭 Real-Time Emotion Detection (Optional)
To use the model for real-time emotion recognition via webcam:
```sh
python src/predict.py
```

# Facial Emotion Recognition App

This app uses a pre-trained VGG16-based model to classify facial emotions into one of seven categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, or Surprise.

## Features
- Upload an image and get emotion predictions.
- Displays confidence scores for each emotion class.

Run the app using ```
streamlit run app.py
```
